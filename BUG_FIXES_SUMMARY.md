# Uno Translate Extension Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Content Script Communication Timeout
**Problem**: `[ERROR] Failed to start continuous translation Error: Content script communication timeout`

**Root Cause**: 
- 10-second timeout was too short for complex translation operations
- No validation of tab accessibility before sending messages
- Poor error handling for content script connection issues

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Increased timeout from 10s to 30s (`CONFIG.COMMUNICATION.CONTENT_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT`)
- ✅ Added tab accessibility check before sending messages
- ✅ Improved error messages for specific connection issues
- ✅ Added content script ready notification system
- ✅ Enhanced retry logic for failed communications

### 2. API Timeout Errors
**Problem**: `API call to /translate failed after 5 attempts: Endpoint request timed out`

**Root Cause**:
- 30-second API timeout was insufficient for large content
- Poor retry logic with exponential backoff
- No content size validation before API calls

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Increased API timeout from 30s to 60s (`CONFIG.API.TIMEOUT`)
- ✅ Increased retry delay from 1s to 2s (`CONFIG.API.RETRY_DELAY`)
- ✅ Added content size limits (50KB for translation, 100KB for summaries)
- ✅ Enhanced retry logic with different delays for different error types
- ✅ Added request validation before API calls

### 3. HTTP 400 Bad Request Errors
**Problem**: `API call to /summarize failed after 5 attempts: HTTP 400`

**Root Cause**:
- Missing required fields in API requests
- Poor request data validation
- No proper error response parsing

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added comprehensive request data validation
- ✅ Enhanced error response parsing with detailed logging
- ✅ Added User-Agent header for better API compatibility
- ✅ Improved error messages with specific field requirements
- ✅ Added fallback error handling for malformed responses

### 4. Content Script Initialization Issues
**Problem**: Content scripts not ready when background script tries to communicate

**Root Cause**:
- No proper initialization sequence
- Missing error handling during setup
- No retry mechanism for failed initialization

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added document readiness check before initialization
- ✅ Implemented retry mechanism for failed initialization
- ✅ Added content script ready notification to background
- ✅ Enhanced error handling during setup process
- ✅ Added proper state management for active tabs

### 5. Translation Process Timeouts
**Problem**: Translation operations taking too long and timing out

**Root Cause**:
- No timeout management for long-running translation operations
- Poor progress tracking
- No cancellation mechanism

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added 60-second timeout for entire translation process
- ✅ Implemented proper timeout cleanup
- ✅ Added progress logging for debugging
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with specific timeout messages
- ✅ Added validation for content before translation

## Configuration Changes

### Timeout Increases
```javascript
// Before
TIMEOUT: 30000, // 30 seconds
RETRY_DELAY: 1000, // 1 second
CONTENT_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT: 10000, // 10 seconds

// After  
TIMEOUT: 60000, // 60 seconds
RETRY_DELAY: 2000, // 2 seconds
CONTENT_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT: 30000, // 30 seconds
```

### New Communication Configuration
```javascript
COMMUNICATION: {
  CONTENT_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT: 30000, // 30 seconds
  SIDEPANEL_TIMEOUT: 15000, // 15 seconds
  MESSAGE_TIMEOUT: 20000 // 20 seconds
}
```

## Error Handling Improvements

### 1. API Error Handling
- ✅ Better error response parsing
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Specific error messages for different failure types
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks for API failures

### 2. Content Script Error Handling
- ✅ Validation of message format
- ✅ Proper error responses to background script
- ✅ Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- ✅ Timeout management for long operations

### 3. Background Script Error Handling

- ✅ Batch processing for large content
- ✅ Streaming translation for better UX
- ✅ Progress tracking and logging

### 3. Memory Management
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of old states
- ✅ LRU cache eviction
- ✅ Periodic cleanup intervals
- ✅ Memory leak prevention

## Monitoring and Debugging

### 1. Enhanced Logging
- ✅ Structured logging with timestamps
- ✅ Context-aware error messages
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Debug mode for development

### 2. Error Tracking
- ✅ Detailed error categorization
- ✅ Stack trace preservation
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Error recovery mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. **Load Test**: Test with very large pages to ensure stability
2. **Stress Test**: Test with rapid language changes and continuous translation
3. **Cross-Browser**: Test on different Chrome versions
4. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on error messages and recovery
5. **Monitoring**: Add analytics to track error rates and performance

## Files Modified

1. `background/background.js` - Main fixes for API and communication
2. `content/content.js` - Content script error handling and initialization
3. `test-fixes.html` - Test page for verification
4. `BUG_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Verification Steps

1. Load the extension in Chrome
2. Open `test-fixes.html` in a tab
3. Open the extension sidepanel
4. Try translating the page to different languages
5. Test continuous translation feature
6. Monitor console for any remaining errors
7. Test error recovery by refreshing the page

The extension should now handle all the previously encountered errors gracefully with proper timeout management, better error messages, and improved reliability.
